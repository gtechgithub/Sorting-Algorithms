# insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

* Time Complexity: O(n*2)

* Auxiliary Space: O(1)

* Boundary Cases: Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort 
  if elements are sorted in reverse order. And it takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

* Algorithmic Paradigm: Incremental Approach
